# Pandas

- **Series** is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index.

- **DataFrame** is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects.

`CSV`, `TSV` is a file format that is used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database.
